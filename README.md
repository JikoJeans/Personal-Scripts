# Personal-Scripts
This repository serves as a remote storage center where I can upload simple code scripts as I apply
what I have learned overtime. I hope to add to this repository semi-consistently however anytime
I make a personal script I will likely upload a copy to both have easy backups but also to allow
anyone else to take them and modify them how they see fit.
